### Correlation between air quality and respiratory diseases

## Summary
The prediction of mortality rates for respiratory diseases
based on air pollutant levels is a critical task in understanding and mitigating the impacts of environmental factors on
public health. In this paper, we describe a machine learning model that uses data on air pollutants to predict respiratory disease mortality rates. A dataset containing historical
records of pollutant concentrations and mortality rates associated with respiratory diseases was used to create and evaluate the model. We used a multi-step method that included
data preparation, implementation of machine learning algorithms and experimental analysis. The performance of the final model are pretty got and they highlight the correlation
between the data. This study presents an in-depth analysis of our approach, experimental design, results and analysis,
highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of our model.
In order to improve the accuracy and usefulness of mortality
rate prediction models for respiratory disorders, we explore
the consequences of our results and provide suggestions for
future research areas.
